# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
## Introduction
This repository explores the process of **Requirement Analysis** within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
The goal is to understand how to gather, prioritize, document, and validate software requirements to ensure successful project execution. the following are what you expet to find here.

Here, you'll see:
- Definitions and concepts
- Examples of functional and non-functional requirements
- Use case diagrams
- Templates and best practices
## What is Requirement Analysis?
 Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.  
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.  
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.


This repo is part of a learning project under the ALX Software Engineering program especially Pro Dev Frontend .
