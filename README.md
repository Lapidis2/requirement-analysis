# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
## Introduction
This repository explores the process of **Requirement Analysis** within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
The goal is to understand how to gather, prioritize, document, and validate software requirements to ensure successful project execution. the following are what you expet to find here.

Here, you'll see:
- Definitions and concepts
- Examples of functional and non-functional requirements
- Use case diagrams
- Templates and best practices
## What is Requirement Analysis?
  The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.
   Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system.
   This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

This repo is part of a learning project under the ALX Software Engineering program especially Pro Dev Frontend .
